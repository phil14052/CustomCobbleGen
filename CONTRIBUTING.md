## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[CustomCobbleGen Code of Conduct](https://github.com/PhilipFlyvholm/CustomCobbleGenblob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://github.com/PhilipFlyvholm/CustomCobbleGen).

To make the development of CustomCobbleGen as smooth as possible has it been choosen to split the support up in two. If you have a config related problem then [join the discord support server](https://discord.gg/Dx6RJvZ) to get a quick response.

If you on the otherhand have found a bug or have an idea for a future feature then you can use [Github Issues](https://github.com/PhilipFlyvholm/CustomCobbleGen/issues). This will make it easy for everyone to see which bugs or feature request to work on.
Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/PhilipFlyvholm/CustomCobbleGen/issues) that might help you. (It will be marked as duplicated and ignored otherwise)

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. a config error (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](https://github.com/PhilipFlyvholm/CustomCobbleGen). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/PhilipFlyvholm/CustomCobbleGen/issues?q=label%3Abug).
Make sure to follow the templates given as it makes the process more smooth :D

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for CustomCobbleGen, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation](https://github.com/PhilipFlyvholm/CustomCobbleGen) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/PhilipFlyvholm/CustomCobbleGen/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.
Make sure to follow the templates given as it makes the process more smooth :D

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/PhilipFlyvholm/CustomCobbleGenissues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux. <!-- this should only be included if the project has a GUI -->
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most CustomCobbleGen users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.
